## System settings
1. To run the Matlab in your computer (with license), please refer to this ReadMe info :  
```bash
https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-extension-for-vscode/blob/main/README.md#get-started
```

2. Add the Matlab application directory in the Settings : 
For Mac OS, I put the following in the Settings
```bash
/Applications/MATLAB_R2024a.app
```

3. Set the workspace to the current folder directory, pwd, which gives me
```bash
'/Users/moka/Documents/GitHub/AlmostMultisecantBFGS'
```
